I am a research assistant at Westlake University, under the supervision of [Professor Yue Zhang](https://frcchang.github.io/). I received my MSc degree with Distinction from University of Southampton and my BSc degree from University of Nottingham. 

My primary research interest lies at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning. Recently, I have been working on language modeling and coreference resolution. Please refer to CV for more detail.
